# south-Philly-Parking
an idea for helping finding parking in South Philly


at the most basic level, this would be helpful to have monthly or weekly updated maps of your city
it would point out what streets are regulated parking and what streets or blocks have unregulated parking

if I am ever able to get to the level of what it could be, it would be awesome if there was some kind of live interaction similar to waze
where a person or a car could scan streets and help you know where there is an empty parking spot

it would also be great if there was a way that people could volunteer their license plate and a call connecting system like Uber has,
so that your not giving out your phone number to a stranger or neighbor, but the app could call you to ask if you can move your vehicle a bit so that it isn't taking up two spots or something like that.
